# table-maker
The goal of this program is to display a large volume of data in nicely designed tables for a final report.  
The data for this project was going to change up until the last minute, so the tables needed to be generated automatically.
Another limitation is that the engineers produced data in excel.
Note that the examples included in this repository contain dummy "lorem ipsum" text in order to conceal confidential information.

INPUTS
The python file translates the engineer's excel file into JSON. 

PROCESS
The app.js file translates JSON data into a series of tables, rendered in a web browser.

OUTPUT
The output is a PDF printed from the web browser, using a format that engineers can manually integrate into their final report.
